 * Decorator for entities that will never be saved with a chunk.
 * Entities implementing this interface are not required to register a save ID.
 *
 * This differs from {@link Entity::canSaveWithChunk()} because it can't be changed after the entity is created.
 * We can't use canSaveWithChunk() to decide whether an entity needs a save ID, but we can use an interface like this.
 * An attribute would also work, but `instanceof NonSaveable` is easier.
